## Installation

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA.git
cd DSA# DSA
```

## Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file or directory. To use a specific implementation, navigate to the appropriate file and follow the instructions in the comments.

## Data Structures
This section will be updated as data structures are added to the repository. Some planned implementations include:
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
